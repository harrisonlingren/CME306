			<p>The Capstone Event for Creative Media and Entertainment students started in 2013.
				This event showcases the incredible talent of our graduating seniors. Each Digital
				Media Production and Interactive Media student is required to complete a senior capstone
				project. This project demonstrates all they have learned over their four years at Butler
				University. Students are responsible for conception and production of each project.
				Because we are so proud of our students and their creations, we host a Capstone Event
				that showcases each of these projects for students, faculty, family, industry professionals,
				and other members of the community to view. Join us for this year's Capstone Event!
