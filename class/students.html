					<h3>Peter Ceko</h3>
					<p><i>DMP Major, CCOM</i></p>
					<p>Growing up as an awkward kid wearing neon colored pants, I turned to music
					as a way to cope with the familiar hardships of being a teenager.  I didn't know it
					at the time, but music would soon take over my life.  It started in highschool when I would
					burn CDs and make playlists for other kids.  I could never get enough music, constantly
					downloading more and more of it. You could find me carrying around a 50 pound Sony
					boombox (which took 12 D batteries) playing the likes of daft punk and any other artists
					that had my attention at the time.</p>
